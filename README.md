# Ragbot Assistant

This is a FastAPI application that serves as a conversational assistant, capable of answering questions, providing weather updates, and processing queries using the Gemini API for generative responses. It also integrates a PDF document loader and a vector database for context-aware answers.

## Features

- **Conversational Assistant**: Answers user queries based on a combination of weather information and document embeddings.
- **Weather Updates**: Retrieves real-time weather data for specified cities using the OpenWeather API.
- **Document Retrieval**: Uses a PDF loader and vector database (FAISS) to provide contextually relevant responses.
- **Environment Variable Management**: Uses a `.env` file to securely manage API keys and sensitive information.

### Prompting
#### The application utilizes prompting techniques to effectively communicate with the Gemini API for generating responses. Here’s how prompting works in this context:

   -Contextual Queries: When a user sends a question, the application prepares a prompt that includes necessary context from weather information or documents relevant to the query. This is crucial for generating accurate and context-aware responses.

   -Dynamic Content Generation: The prompts can be tailored based on the type of query (e.g., general knowledge, specific data requests). For example, if a user asks about the weather, the prompt might combine the user’s question with the latest weather data fetched from the OpenWeather API.

   -Response Optimization: The structure of the prompts is designed to elicit detailed and relevant responses from the Gemini API, ensuring that users receive comprehensive answers. By providing sufficient context and guidance in the prompts, the assistant can generate higher-quality responses.


## Technologies Used

1. **FastAPI**: 
   - A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It allows for rapid development and is built to be efficient and easy to use.

2. **Langchain**: 
   - A framework that provides tools for loading documents, splitting text, and managing interactions with language models. It simplifies the integration of natural language processing capabilities into applications.

3. **Google Generative AI**: 
   - A service that allows for the generation of text and embeddings using state-of-the-art language models. It provides powerful capabilities for understanding and generating natural language.

4. **FAISS**: 
   - A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It’s used for fast retrieval of relevant documents based on the user's query by comparing embeddings.

5. **Sarvaam Text-to-Speech API:**
    - A powerful API that converts text into speech, allowing users to listen to responses generated by the assistant. This feature enhances user interaction by providing an auditory feedback mechanism, making the application more accessible and engaging.

## Installation
### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jay-arora31/Ragbot/
   cd Ragbot
  
2. Create a Virtual Environment

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv venv

```
3. Activate the Virtual Environment
   
On Windows:
``` bash
venv\Scripts\activate

```

On macOS/Linux:
``` bash
source venv/bin/activate

```
4. Install the required packages:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

5. Create a .env file in the root of the project directory and add your API keys:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
SARVAAM_API_KEY=your_sarvaam_api_key
```
6. Replace your_gemini_api_key, your_openweather_api_key, and your_sarvaam_api_key with your actual API keys.


### Frontend Setup 

1. Navigate to Frontend Directory:
   ``` bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install Node.js Dependencies:
   ``` bash
    npm install
   ```
3. Run the React Application:
    ``` bash
    npm start
    ```
